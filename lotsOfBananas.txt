Sringeri Srinivas walked to the the village and found a world made of only 
bananas. It was his dream come true! 
After a few weeks Sringeri built a big banana house that he lived in.
He lived a happy life and raised a family. 
Little did he know, however, that the illuminati were after him. 
A little known fact about the illuminati; they were the world's number 1 supplier of bananas.
And they weren't happy that Sringeri had so many bananas. 
Sringeri lived through mutiple assassination attempts, comepletely obvilious until one day, when he noticed something was wrong.
There was a monkey in his banana house!
He confronted the monkey, a professional hitman who was promised the banana house as a reward for taking out Sringeri.
Sringeri didn't make it.
Just kidding, Sringeri kicked the monkey out of his house.
After that event,
Sringeri swore that he would get revenge on the person who hired the monkey hitman.
He began his ultimate quest to find this person on that day.
He never found him unfortunately.
